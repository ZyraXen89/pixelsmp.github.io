    <h1>INDONESIA AT A GLANCE</h1>
    <h5>-----------------------------------------<h5>
    <h6>Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world. Indonesia has more than 17,000 islands, of which only about 7,000 are inhabited. Kalimantan, Java, Sulawesi, Sumatra and Papua are the main islands in Indonesia. In addition, Indonesia also has small islands such as Bali, Karimunjawa, Gili and Lombok which are local and international tourist destinations. The capital city of Indonesia is Jakarta, which is located on the island of Java.

From a geographical point of view, the Indonesian archipelago is located between 5° 54′ 08″ north longitude to 11° 08′ 20″ south longitude and 95°00'38“ to 141° 01'12" east longitude. Some islands are located on the equator. Therefore, day and night have almost the same time, which is 12 hours. Based on its wide geographical location, the territory of Indonesia is divided into 3 time zones, namely WIB (Western Indonesian Time), WITA (Central Indonesian Time) and WIT (Eastern Indonesian Time). From one island to another there can be a time difference of up to 8 hours.

In addition to beautiful islands, Indonesia's tropical climate also makes Indonesia a major tourist destination. The best time to travel to Indonesia is during the summer which lasts from April to October. March and November are the change of seasons. At the change of seasons, the weather in Indonesia can be erratic. Rain, hot sun and heavy winds can come together in one day. Meanwhile, the rainy season usually lasts from December to March.

“Bhinneka Tunggal Ika” which means “diverse but one” is the national logo of the Republic of Indonesia. This logo depicts a pluralistic but still one Indonesian society, which is also a guide for the life of the Indonesian people. Until 2016, Indonesian citizens are estimated to reach 250 million people. Indonesia is the country with the 4th largest population in the world after China, India and America (Source: Statista.de, 2016). Indonesian society consists of about 300 tribes, such as Javanese, Sundanese, Batak, Chinese, Dayak and Papuans. Each tribe has its own dialect. Overall there are more than 360 dialects that enrich Indonesian culture. However, "Indonesian" is the national language which is also the unifier of the Indonesian nation. English which is an international language is also a language that is often used in Indonesia. English is included in the primary school curriculum in Indonesia and is the language of business. In addition, Indonesia also has a plurality in religious life. Most of the Indonesian population embraces Islam. Less than 10% of Indonesian society is divided into several religious groups such as Roman Catholic, Christian, Hindu and Buddhist. A small part of the Indonesian people also still adhere to traditional religions such as kejawen which is often found on the island of Java.</h6>
